# LAYOUT.md

## Purpose
This document defines the website’s tab layout and the content structure for each tab. The goal is to keep the navigation minimal and recruiter-friendly while still presenting all necessary information.

---

# Tab Layout

## Primary Goal
The site should be easy to scan quickly by recruiters. A maximum of **4–5 top-level tabs** is ideal to prevent cognitive overload. Each tab should have a clear purpose and contain concise, relevant content.

---

## Recommended Tab Structure (Final)

### Tab 1 — Home (Landing Page)
**Purpose:**  
Serve as the primary entry point and the “first impression” page. It should clearly communicate who you are, what you do, and what you’re seeking, without overwhelming the visitor.

**Content Suggestions:**
- **Hero section**
  - Short headline (1 line) describing your role (e.g., “Software Engineer | Cloud & DevOps”)
  - 1–2 sentence summary of your skills and what you build
- **Key highlights / value props**
  - 3–5 bullet points or small cards (e.g., “Infrastructure as Code”, “Kubernetes”, “Python”, “Full-stack”, “Self-hosting”)
- **Call-to-action buttons**
  - “View Resume”
  - “See Projects”
  - “Contact”
- **Optional:**
  - A subtle animated background or gradient
  - A simple visual timeline / skill graph
  - A short quote or professional motto

**Why this is important:**  
Recruiters spend seconds on a page. This page should make it immediately obvious what you do and what you’re looking for.

---

### Tab 2 — Resume (Work Experience)
**Purpose:**  
Provide a structured, readable version of your professional experience and allow recruiters to download your resume.

**Content Suggestions:**
- **Downloadable resume button**
  - A clearly labeled button: “Download Resume (PDF)”
- **Experience summary**
  - Short bullet list of your most relevant roles and achievements
- **Skills section**
  - Organized list (or small skill cards) grouped by category:
    - Languages
    - DevOps / Cloud
    - Tools
    - Other relevant skills
- **Education / Certifications**
  - Short list

**Why this is important:**  
Some recruiters want to skim on the website first; others want the official resume. This tab should satisfy both.

---

### Tab 3 — Projects
**Purpose:**  
Showcase real work that demonstrates your technical abilities. Projects should be presented in a clean, scannable format.

**Content Suggestions:**
- **Project cards**
  - Each card should include:
    - Title
    - Short description (1–2 lines)
    - Tech stack tags
    - Links:
      - GitHub repo
      - Live demo (if applicable)
      - Blog post or documentation (if applicable)
- **Featured Projects**
  - 2–3 highlighted projects with deeper details:
    - Problem statement
    - Approach
    - Key learnings
    - Screenshots or diagrams
- **Optional**
  - Filters or sorting (e.g., by date or tech stack)
  - A “Labs” subsection for small experiments or learning projects

**Why this is important:**  
Projects are the strongest proof of competence. Recruiters often use this tab to assess real skill.

---

### Tab 4 — Contact
**Purpose:**  
Provide a clean and simple way for recruiters to reach you.

**Content Suggestions:**
- **Contact form**
  - Name
  - Email
  - Message
  - Submit button
- **Direct contact options**
  - Email link
  - LinkedIn link
  - GitHub link
- **Optional**
  - Availability status (“Open to work”, “Currently employed”, etc.)
  - Location (city + region)

**Why this is important:**  
Recruiters should not have to search for contact info. Make it easy and obvious.

---

## Optional Tab (Only if needed)
If you want one more tab without overcrowding the navigation, add:

### Tab 5 — About (Optional)
**Purpose:**  
Give a slightly deeper view into your background, interests, and work philosophy.

**Content Suggestions:**
- Short personal story (1–2 paragraphs)
- Career goals
- What kind of roles you’re targeting
- Core values and working style
- Optional: a “fun facts” section to add personality

**Why this is optional:**  
If your Home tab already contains enough personal context, this tab may be redundant. Use it only if you have meaningful content to add without repeating.

---

## Final Recommendation
To keep the site recruiter-friendly, the best structure is:

1. **Home**
2. **Resume**
3. **Projects**
4. **Contact**

This layout is minimal, clean, and covers all essential information without overwhelming the visitor.

---

## Navigation & UX Notes
- Use a **sticky top navigation** for easy access
- Highlight the active tab
- Ensure navigation is **keyboard accessible**
- Use concise tab names (single word when possible)

---

## Tab Naming Summary (Final)
| Tab | Name | Purpose |
| --- | ---- | ------- |
| 1 | Home | Landing + overview |
| 2 | Resume | Work experience + downloadable resume |
| 3 | Projects | Technical proof of skill |
