# Project Background & Goals

## Background
This working project directory is for my personal portfolio website which I plan to host via GitHub pages.

## End Goal
I would like this website to serve as a minimalistc yet stylized, performant, SEO optimized, mobile friendly, accesiblity requirements aware, and eye-catching portfolio website. I plan to have the website display information about my career goals, experience, personality, personal projects; alongside, including some basics like my resume (downloadable) and a contact page. 

## docs/ Directory Purpose
Within the project you will find a docs/ directory. It will contain markdown files that document various aspects of this project. Refer to the below layout to understand the purpose off all the files within the docs/ directory structure.

## docs/ File Structure Guide
.
└── docs
    └── style_inspiration - Contains screenshots or images that I would like the website style to take inspiration from. If a file name begins with "website_" that will tell you it's a picture of a website I would like to take inspiration from.
    └── LAYOUT.md - Contains information about website layout (i.e. tab names, layout structure, etc.)
    └── TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS.md - Contains information about the technical requirements that should be met while building this website
    └── PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md - Contains the complete file and directory structure for the project with descriptions and conventions
    └── CURRENT_SESSION.md - Changelog of recent changes and next steps to complete
    └── features - sub-directory intended to document more complex features

## Instructions for handling every single prompt I submit
1. Based on the instruction and request I have sent review the above docs/ file structure guide to find and read relevant files that would assist you in helping me complete the current request.
2. Always explain your plan and what you are planning to implement or employ combined to when you make requests for code changes, file changes, etc. so I can review your reasoning and then hit yes or no to allow you to proceed.
3. When contributing code always refer to the docs/TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS.md file which will also contain coding practices you should follow.
4. When relevant and appropriate determined by analyzing whether you changes, be sure to accordingly update any docs/ files, for example the file structure of the docs/ project folder changes because you added a found bug to a docs/BUGS.md file to better keep track of the project status. We need to update the relevant, now effected, .md files such as this CLAUDE.md file which contains a docs/ File Structure Guide section which now needs to be udaptes to reflect and include the new docs/BUGS.md file. The only caveat being, you should only update critical and expected documentation because we do no want to grow these files too big in size. Worst case, make a reference within a file like this one to refer to a new file you create to continue documentation. I need every .md file to be able to be read within your token window essentially.
5. Any time you create a new feature thats not something general/fundamental (example: tab switching, button click behavior) but instead a real feature like a "sort listed projects on the Projects tab by date or alphabetical", then document the feature with an appropriately named markdown file in the /docs/features directory.
6. If you ever add code, it must be tested before considering it complete. Always output your testing approach and method alongside this testing so I can track your testing approach and test it myself alongside you.
7. If tests pass, be sure to add the test approach as a test script in the test/ directory, be sure to organize these test scripts and name them clearly and appropriately for future testing. Document the purpose of every test script in a header comment and document the purpose of every test function within the script.
